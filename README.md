# Memory Card

This project is intended to practice functional components, state, hooks and React in general. It's a simple game where you rely on memory to try and click all of the cards without clicking on cards you've already clicked on twice as the cards are shuffled around randomly. Try it, it's kind of fun.

# Reflections/Venting

Early on, I had difficulty trying to keep all the logic in one component and achieve proper game functionality. I managed better results when I started taking advantage of components and the fact that each component can hold it's own state and functions. The structure of my app began to change with more components, and I found the code cleaner and easier to read. I then consulted the React docs for ways to reset my state under certain conditions, and found some really helpful information on switching between components, which I used to great effect in completing the app. Overall, this project was great hands on experience and practice with React.
